# Theme Information #
This theme was originally authored by Brian Gardner, and can be found [here](http://www.briangardner.com/themes/dropshadow-wordpress-theme.htm). I had some issues
with the 500px main content width restriction, so I adapted the overall content width to 960px
and bumped the main content div to 640px.

# Installation #
